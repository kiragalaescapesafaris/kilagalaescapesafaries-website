Landscape, Rich culture and tradition, climate, soils, drainage, relief, plateaus, natural beauty, unique magnificent features and 
creatures, plus its very accommodative hospitable local people. 

These rich attributes are the reason as to why the country was referred to as  the “Pearl of Africa” by Sir Winston Churchill in his book My African Journey written in 1908 after his tour to Uganda. Churchill concluded by declaring the country the Pearl of Africa, emphasizing Uganda’s eye-catching colors, bird life, reptiles, insects, beasts, mammals, vegetation, and climate.
